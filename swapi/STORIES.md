# SWAPI Data Platform - Project Stories

## Epic Overview
Build a comprehensive data extraction, normalization, and API platform for Star Wars API (SWAPI) data. The platform will consume data from swapi.tech, store it in a structured format, and expose it through an authenticated API for client consumption.

**External API Reference:** `https://swapi.tech/api/films`  
**Key Entities:** Films, Starships, Planets (with detail endpoints)

## Story 1: Database Schema Design

**Story ID:** SWAPI-001  
**Epic:** SWAPI Data Platform  
**Priority:** Highest  
**Story Points:** 8

### Description
As a data engineer, I need a well-designed database schema that can efficiently store Star Wars films, starships, and planets data along with their relationships, so that we can support fast queries and maintain data integrity.

### Business Value
A proper schema foundation is critical for:
- Efficient data retrieval and querying
- Data integrity and consistency
- Supporting future feature expansion
- Enabling analytics and reporting capabilities

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Schema supports storage of all film data from the SWAPI films endpoint
- [ ] Schema supports storage of all starship data with proper relationships to films
- [ ] Schema supports storage of all planet data with proper relationships to films
- [ ] Relationships between entities (films ↔ starships, films ↔ planets) are properly represented
- [ ] Schema includes appropriate constraints to maintain data integrity
- [ ] Schema handles nullable fields appropriately based on source API data

### Out of Scope
- Migration strategy (separate story)
- Indexing strategy (to be determined after query patterns emerge)
- Archive/historical data retention policies

### Dependencies
None - this is a foundational story

### Notes
- Review SWAPI API documentation thoroughly to understand all fields and relationships
- Consider future extensibility for other SWAPI entities (characters, vehicles, species, etc.)
- Data from swapi.tech may have inconsistencies - schema should be resilient

## Story 2: Data Extraction Layer

**Story ID:** SWAPI-002  
**Epic:** SWAPI Data Platform  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8

### Description
As a data engineer, I need an automated system to extract data from the SWAPI external API endpoints, so that we have a reliable pipeline to fetch all films, starships, and planets data.

### Business Value
Automated extraction enables:
- Keeping our data synchronized with the source
- Reducing manual data entry and associated errors
- Audit trail of all extraction runs

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System can fetch all films from `https://swapi.tech/api/films`
- [ ] System can follow and fetch detail endpoints for starships referenced in films
- [ ] System can follow and fetch detail endpoints for planets referenced in films
- [ ] Raw API responses are saved to S3 for each extraction run
- [ ] Audit table tracks each extraction run (timestamp, status, S3 URL to raw response)
- [ ] Extraction handles network failures with basic retry logic
- [ ] Extraction can be triggered on-demand

### Out of Scope
- Data transformation/normalization (separate story)
- Scheduled/automated runs
- Advanced error handling

### Dependencies
- None (can run against external API)

### Notes
- SWAPI provides detail URLs within response payloads - extraction should follow these
- S3 storage provides backup and ability to re-process data if needed

## Story 3: Data Normalization Pipeline

**Story ID:** SWAPI-003  
**Epic:** SWAPI Data Platform  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 8

### Description
As a data engineer, I need a normalization pipeline that transforms raw SWAPI data into our standardized schema, so that downstream consumers have clean, consistent, and queryable data.

### Business Value
Normalization provides:
- Consistent data format for API consumers
- Proper relationship mapping between entities
- Clean queryable data

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pipeline transforms raw film data into normalized schema format
- [ ] Pipeline transforms raw starship data into normalized schema format
- [ ] Pipeline transforms raw planet data into normalized schema format
- [ ] Relationships between films, starships, and planets are correctly established
- [ ] Pipeline handles missing or null values appropriately
- [ ] Pipeline handles duplicate records gracefully
- [ ] Normalized data is persisted to the database schema

### Out of Scope
- Data enrichment from external sources
- Complex data quality validation

### Dependencies
- SWAPI-001 (Database Schema Design) - must be complete
- SWAPI-002 (Data Extraction Layer) - must be complete or use sample data

### Notes
- Some fields may require basic parsing (e.g., dates, lists)
- Should handle updates to existing records

## Story 4: Authenticated Client API

**Story ID:** SWAPI-004  
**Epic:** SWAPI Data Platform  
**Priority:** High  
**Story Points:** 13

### Description
As an API product owner, I need a secure, authenticated REST API that exposes our normalized Star Wars data, so that authorized clients can consume films, starships, and planets data programmatically.

### Business Value
The API enables:
- Controlled access to curated Star Wars data
- Foundation for building client applications
- Protection against unauthorized access

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API requires authentication for all data endpoints
- [ ] API provides endpoint to list all films with pagination
- [ ] Film response includes IDs for associated starships and planets
- [ ] API provides endpoint to fetch starship or planet details by ID
- [ ] API responses follow consistent JSON structure with appropriate status codes
- [ ] API handles errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
- [ ] Authentication mechanism prevents unauthorized access

### Out of Scope
- GraphQL interface
- User management UI
- Advanced filtering/search
- Rate limiting

### Dependencies
- SWAPI-001 (Database Schema Design) - must be complete
- SWAPI-003 (Data Normalization Pipeline) - recommended to have data available

### Notes
- Use simple authentication mechanism (API keys or JWT)
- Basic CORS support for browser clients
