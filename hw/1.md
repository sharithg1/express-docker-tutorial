* Create a modal that allows users to submit an order to the database. This should be done as a Client-Side Request (CSR) implementation.

Hints:
- You will be using the browser's `fetch` api to make a POST request
- Design an appropriate API endpoint to handle the order submission
- No need to create a new React app - implement this within the existing codebase
- Think about what order data you need to collect in the modal (check the database schema)
- Consider proper error handling and loading states
